First, by realizing that we have a\ndisease we will always have. No matter how long we've been clean, no matter how\nmuch better our lives have become, no matter what the extent of our spiritual\nhealing, we are still addicts. Our disease waits patiently, ready to spring the trap if\nwe give it the opportunity.\n\nVigilance is a daily accomplishment. We strive to be constantly alert and ready to\ndeal with signs of trouble. Not that we should live in irrational fear that something\nhorrible will possess us if we drop our guard for an instant; we just take normal\nprecautions. Daily prayer, regular meeting attendance, and choosing not to\ncompromise spiritual principles for the easier way are acts of vigilance. We take\ninventory as necessary, share with others whenever we are asked, and carefully\nnurture our recovery. Above all, we stay aware!\n\nWe have a daily reprieve from our addiction as long as we remain vigilant. Each day,\nwe carry the principles of recovery into all we do, and each night, we thank our\nHigher Power for another day clean.\n\nJust for today: I will be vigilant, doing everything necessary to guard my recovery.\n\n\n\n4\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

We are faced with small\ninconveniences daily. From untangling the knots in our children's shoelaces to\nstanding in line at the market, our days are filled with minor difficulties that we must\nsomehow deal with.\n\nIf we're not careful, we may find ourselves dealing with these difficulties by bullying\nour way through each problem or grinding our teeth while giving ourselves a stern\nlecture about how we should handle them. These are extreme examples of poor\ncoping skills, but even if we're not this bad there's probably room for improvement.\n\nEach time life presents us with another little setback to our daily plans, we can\nsimply take a deep breath and talk to the God of our understanding. Knowing we can\ndraw patience, tolerance, or whatever we need from that Power, we find ourselves\ncoping better and smiling more often.\n\nJust for today: I will take a deep breath and talk to my God whenever I feel\nfrustrated.\n\n\n\n5\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

Some of\nus set our sights on amassing personal possessions. We thought recovery equaled\noutward success. But recovery does not equal success. Today, we believe that our\ngreatest need is for spiritual guidance and strength.\n\nThe greatest damage done to us by our addiction was the damage done to our\nspirituality. Our primary motivation was dictated by our disease: to get, to use, and\nto find ways and means to get more. Enslaved by our overwhelming need for drugs,\nour lives lacked purpose and connection. We were spiritually bankrupt.\n\nSooner or later, we realize that our greatest need in recovery is \"for knowledge of\nGod's will for us and the strength to carry that out.\" There, we find the direction and\nsense of purpose our addiction had hidden from us. In our God's will we find freedom\nfrom self-will. No longer driven only by our own needs, we are free to live with\nothers on an equal footing.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with outward success. But without the spiritual connection\noffered by the NA program, our greatest need in recovery goes unmet, regardless of\nhow \"successful\" we may be.\n\nJust for today: I will seek the fulfillment of my greatest need: a vital, guiding\nconnection with the God of my understanding.\n\n\n\n6\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

Our minds were not occupied with anything decent or\nhealthy, and we knew it. Our time, money, and energy weren't spent building loving\nrelationships, sharing with others, or seeking to better our communities. We were\ntrapped in a spiral of obsession and compulsion that went only in one direction:\ndownward.\n\nIn recovery, our journey down that spiral path has been cut short. But what is it that\nhas turned us around, drawing us back upward into the open spaces of the wide, free\nworld? The love of the fellowship has done this.\n\nIn the company of other addicts, we knew we would not be rejected. By the example\nof other addicts, we were shown how to begin taking a positive part in the life\naround us. When we were unsure which way to turn, when we stumbled, when we\nhad to correct a wrong we'd done, we knew our fellow members were there to\nencourage us.\n\nSlowly, we've gotten the feel of our freedom. No longer are we locked up in our\ndisease; we are free to build and grow and share along with everyone else. And\nwhen we need support to take our next step, it is there.

We have a lot of knowledge about\nwhat's wrong with us. But in and of itself, knowledge never helped us stay clean for\nany length of time.\n\nMembers who have achieved long-term recovery will be the first to admit that the\nlonger they are here, the more they have to learn. But they do know one thing: By\nfollowing this simple Twelve Step program, they have been able to stay clean. They\nno longer ask \"why\"; they ask \"how.\" The value of endless speculation pales in\ncomparison to the experience of addicts who've found a way to stay clean and live\nclean.\n\nThis doesn't mean we don't ask \"why\" when it's appropriate. We don't come to NA\nand stop thinking! But in the beginning, it's often a very good idea to reword our\nquestions. Instead of asking \"why,\" we ask \"how.\" How do I work this step? How\noften should I attend meetings? How do I stay clean?\n\nJust for today: I don't have all the answers, but I know where to find the ones that\nmatter.

Not only is this way of life better than the hell we lived, it is better\nthan any life that we have ever known.\"\nBasic Text p. 103\n\nFew of us have any interest in \"recovering\" what we had before we started using.\nMany of us suffered severely from physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Getting\nhigh and staying high seemed like the only possible way to cope with such abuse.\nOthers suffered in less noticeable but equally painful ways before addiction took\nhold. We lacked direction and purpose. We were spiritually empty. We felt isolated,\nunable to empathize with others. We had none of the things that give life its sense\nand value. We took drugs in a vain attempt to fill the emptiness inside ourselves.\nMost of us wouldn't want to \"recover\" what we used to have.\n\nUltimately, the recovery we find in NA is something different: a chance at a new life.\nWe've been given tools to clear the wreckage from our lives. We've been given\nsupport in courageously setting forth on a new path. And we've been given the gift of\nconscious contact with a Power greater than ourselves, providing us with the inner\nstrength and direction we so sorely lacked in the past.\n\nRecovering? Yes, in every way. We're recovering a whole new life, better than\nanything we ever dreamed possible.

Well, then, we think, what does that mean? We start to\nwonder if we're grown-ups yet. We check our lives and yes, all the trappings of\nadulthood are there: the checkbook, the children, the job, the responsibilities. On\nthe inside, though, we often feel like children. We're still confused by life much of the\ntime. We don't always know how to act.

Our best\nmeasure of growth is our spiritual condition, the basis of our recovery. If we're still\ndepending on people, places, and things to provide our inner satisfaction, like a child\ndepending on its parents for everything, we do indeed have some growing to do. But\nif we stand secure on the foundation of our spiritual condition, considering its\nmaintenance our most important responsibility, we can claim maturity.

We treat our sponsor with\nrespect. They are not a trash can designed for us to dump our garbage in. They have\ntheir times of trial, just as we do, and sometimes need our support. They are human,\nhave feelings, and appreciate our concern. Maybe they would like to receive a card in\nthe mail or a phone call expressing our love.\n\nWhatever we do to return our sponsor's kindness will enhance our personal recovery,\nnot to mention the joy we'll bring to our sponsor.\n\nJust for today: My sponsor has cared for me when I couldn't care for myself.

To be prepared, we study our notes and literature between \"lessons.\" Just\nas students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge during tests, so do we\nhave the opportunity to apply our recovery during times of crisis.\n\nAs always, we have a choice in how we will approach life's challenges. We can dread\nand avoid them as threats to our serenity or we can gratefully accept them as\nopportunities for growth. By confirming the principles we've learned in recovery,\nlife's challenges give us increased strength. Without such challenges, however, we\ncould forget what we've learned and begin to stagnate. These are the opportunities\nthat prod us to new spiritual awakenings.\n\nWe will find that there is often a period of rest after each crisis, giving us time to get\naccustomed to our new skills.

Our connection with the world, and with reality itself, was\nsevered. Our lives lost meaning, and we withdrew further and further from reality.\n\nThe NA program is designed especially for people like us. It helps reconnect us to the\nlife we were meant to live, drawing us out of our isolation. We stop lying to ourselves\nabout our condition; we admit our powerlessness and the unmanageability of our\nlives. We develop faith that our lives can improve, that recovery is possible, and that\nhappiness is not permanently beyond our grasp. We get honest; we stop hiding; we\n\"show up and tell the truth\" no matter what.

If we truly believe that we are powerless over our addiction, we will\nnot choose to be around drugs.

Most of us\ncome to NA hanging our heads in shame, thinking about the past and wishing we\ncould go back and change it. Our fantasies and expectations about the future may be\nso extreme that, on our first date with someone, we find ourselves wondering which\nlawyer we'll use for the divorce. Almost every experience causes us to remember\nsomething from the past or begin projecting into the future.\n\nAt first, it's difficult to stay in the moment. It seems as though our minds won't stop.\nWe have a hard time just enjoying ourselves. Each time we realize that our thoughts\nare not focused on what's happening right now, we can pray and ask a loving God to\nhelp us get out of ourselves. If we regret the past, we make amends by living\ndifferently today; if we dread the future, we work on living responsibly today.\n\nWhen we work the steps and pray each time we discover we're not living in the\npresent, we'll notice that those times aren't occurring as often as they used to.

If we decide to be part\nof the solution instead of the problem, we are headed in the right direction.\n\nOur personal recovery and the growth of NA is contingent upon maintaining an\natmosphere of recovery in our meetings. Are we willing to help our group deal\nconstructively with conflict? As group members, do we strive to work out difficulties\nopenly, honestly, and fairly?

And, as trusted servants, do we take into\nconsideration the effect our actions might have on newcomers?\n\nService can bring out both the best and the worst in us. But it is often through\nservice that we begin to get in touch with some of our more pressing defects of\ncharacter.

We may think that\nbecause we've had a spiritual awakening in our own lives we should be able to\npersuade another addict to find recovery. But there are limits to what we can do to\nhelp another addict.\n\nWe cannot force them to stop using. We cannot give them the results of the steps or\ngrow for them.

We need to remember that we are powerless over our addiction, not our\npersonal behavior. Many of us have misused the concept of powerlessness to avoid\nmaking decisions or to hold onto things we had outgrown. We have claimed\npowerlessness over our own actions. We have blamed others for our circumstances\nrather than taking positive action to change those circumstances.

We didn't\nbelieve there was an alternative to living in our disease-or perhaps we didn't want to\nbelieve.

Many tools are\nat our disposal: the Twelve Steps, the support of our sponsor, the fellowship of other\nrecovering addicts, and the care of our Higher Power.

That is the spiritual death we experience when we are separated\nfrom our Higher Power. If we use, the spiritual relationship we have nurtured over\nthe years will weaken and perhaps disappear. We will feel truly alone.\n\nThere is no doubt that we have periods of darkness in our recovery. There is only\none way we can make it through those troubling times: with faith. If we believe that\nour Higher Power is with us, then we know that all will be well.\n\nNo matter how badly we may feel in our recovery, a relapse is never the answer.\nTogether, we find recovery. If we stay clean, the darkness will lift and we will find a\ndeeper connection to our Higher Power.\n\nJust for today: I thank my Higher Power for the gift of NA.

We just\n\"did things\" often without knowing why or what the results would be. Life had little\nvalue or meaning.\n\nThe Twelve Step process gives meaning to our lives; in working the steps, we come\nto accept both the dark and the bright sides of ourselves. We strip away the denial\nthat kept us from comprehending addiction's affect on us. We honestly examine\nourselves, picking out the patterns in our thoughts, our feelings, and our behavior.\nWe gain humility and perspective by fully disclosing ourselves to another human\nbeing. In seeking to have our shortcomings removed, we develop a working\nappreciation of our own powerlessness and the strength provided by a Power greater\nthan we are. With our enhanced understanding of ourselves, we gain greater insight\ninto and acceptance of others.\n\nThe Twelve Steps are the key to a process we call \"life.\" In working the steps, they\nbecome a part of us and we become a part of the life around us.

Often, the first\nperson we take that risk with is our sponsor-someone we respect, someone we\nidentify with, someone we have reason to trust.\n\nAs we open up to our sponsor, a bond develops between us. We disclose our secrets\nand develop confidence in our sponsor's discretion. We share our concerns and learn\nto value our sponsor's experience. We share our pain and are met with empathy.

Their opinions of us, and how those opinions make us feel, can have\npositive value.

We share our gratitude\ndirectly from our hearts; with their hearts, others hear and understand.

We have all made good\nfriendships through our home group, and we wouldn't trade that warmth for the\nworld.\n\nBut sometimes we must take inventory of what our group is doing to fulfill its\nprimary purpose-to carry the message to the still-suffering addict. Sometimes when\nwe go to our meetings, we know almost everyone and get caught up in the laughter\nand fun. But what about the newcomer? Have we remembered to reach out to the\nnew people who may be sitting by themselves, lonely and frightened? Do we\nremember to welcome those visiting our group?\n\nThe love found in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous helps us recover from\naddiction.

Were we willing to drive many miles to get drugs? Yes, we usually\nwere. Then it makes sense that, if we are as concerned about staying clean as we\nwere about using, we will try anything to find a ride to a meeting.\n\nIn our addiction, didn't we often do crazy, insane things or use unknown substances\nat the direction of others? Then why do we often find it so hard to take direction in\nrecovery, especially when the direction is designed to help us grow? And when we\nused, didn't we often, in desperation, turn to our Higher Power, saying, \"Please, just\nget me out of this one!\" Then why do we find it so hard to ask for God's help in our\nrecovery?\n\nWhen we used, we usually had an open mind when it came to finding ways and\nmeans to get more drugs. If we can apply the same principle of open-mindedness to\nour recovery, we may surprise ourselves by how easily we begin to grasp the NA\nprogram. Our best thinking, it is often said, got us into the rooms of Narcotics\nAnonymous. If we are willing to go to any lengths, follow directions, and stay open-\nminded, we can stay clean.\n\nJust for today: I am willing to go to any lengths to stay clean.

If we do not take time to\nappreciate both, perhaps we will miss something that will help us grow.\"\nIP No.8, \"Just for Today\"\n\nMost of us seem to unconsciously judge what happens in our lives each day as good\nor bad, success or failure. We tend to feel happy about the \"good\" and angry,\nfrustrated, or guilty about the \"bad.\" Good and bad feelings, though, often have little\nto do with what's truly good or bad for us. We may learn more from our failures than\nour successes, especially if failure has come from taking a risk.\n\nAttaching value judgments to our emotional reactions ties us to our old ways of\nthinking.

Once we do, most of us are at least\nwilling to consider seeking the help of some Power greater than our disease. The first\npractical exposure many of us have to that kind of Power is in the NA group. Perhaps\nthat's where we should start in developing our own understanding of God.\n\nOne evidence of the Power in the group is the unconditional love shown when NA\nmembers help one another without expectation of reward. The group's collective\nexperience in recovery is itself a Power greater than our own, for the group has\npractical knowledge of what works and what doesn't. And the fact that addicts keep\ncoming to NA meetings, day after day, is a demonstration of the presence of a\nHigher Power, some attractive, caring force at work that helps addicts stay clean and\ngrow.\n\nAll these things are evidence of a Power that can be found in NA groups. When we\nlook around with an open mind, each of us will be able to identify other signs of that\nPower. It doesn't matter if we call it God, a Higher Power, or anything else-just as\nlong as we find a way to incorporate that Power into our daily lives.\n\nJust for today: I will open my eyes and my mind to signs of a Power that exists in\nmy NA group.

Things new and unfamiliar serve as\nchallenges, whether those things appear good or bad to us. We are challenged by\nobstacles and opposition from within ourselves and from without. New and difficult\nthings, obstacles and opposition, all are a part of \"life on life's terms.\" Living clean\nmeans learning to meet challenge.\n\nMany of us, consciously or unconsciously, took drugs to avoid meeting challenge.\nMany of us were equally afraid of failure and success. Each time we declined the\nday's challenge, we suffered a loss of self-esteem. Some of us used drugs to mask\nthe shame we felt. Each time we did that, we became even less able to meet our\nchallenges and more likely to use.\n\nBy working the NA program, we've found the tools we need to successfully meet any\nchallenge. We've come to believe in a Power greater than ourselves, a Power that\ncares for our will and our lives. We've asked that Power to remove our character\ndefects, those things that made our lives unmanageable. We've taken action to\nimprove our conscious contact with that Higher Power. Through the steps, we've\nbeen given the ability to stop using drugs and start living. Each day, we are faced\nwith new challenges.

Being lonely is a state of\nthe heart, an emptiness that makes us feel sad and sometimes hopeless. Loneliness\nis not always alleviated when we enter into relationships or surround ourselves with\nothers. Some of us are lonely even in a room full of people. Many of us came to\nNarcotics Anonymous out of the desperate loneliness of our addiction.

The best cure is to begin a relationship with a Higher\nPower that can help fill the emptiness of our heart. We find that when we have a\nbelief in a Higher Power, we never have to feel lonely. We can be alone more\ncomfortably when we have a conscious contact with a God of our understanding.\n\nWe often find deep fulfillment in our interactions with others as we progress in our\nrecovery.

We stay in situations that\nare no longer working far longer than we have to simply because what is familiar\nfeels safer than the unknown.\n\nAny change involves overcoming fear. \"What if I'm alone forever?\" we might think if\nwe consider leaving our lover. \"What if I find out I'm incompetent?\" we may wonder\nwhen we contemplate changing careers.

But remaking the world and everyone in it to suit our tastes would\nsolve nothing. After all, the idea that the world was to blame for all our problems\nwas the attitude that kept us using-and that attitude nearly killed us.\n\nIn the course of working the steps, we begin to ask ourselves hard questions about\nthe roles we ourselves have played in creating the unacceptable lives we've lived. In\nmost cases, we've found that what needed changing was our own attitude and our\nown actions, not the people, places, and things around us.\n\nIn recovery, we pray for wisdom to know the difference between what can and can't\nbe changed. Then, once we see the truth of our situation, we pray for the willingness\nto change ourselves.\n\nJust for today: Higher Power, grant me the wisdom to know the difference between\nwhat can be changed and what I must accept.

Years of using people and allowing\nthem to use us had taken their toll on our ability to trust anyone, ourselves included.\nBut the love and acceptance we found in Narcotics Anonymous encouraged us to\nreach out and get close to\nothers.\n\nThe longer we stayed clean, the more we began to long for greater intimacy with our\nloved ones. We began reaching out in deeper, more meaningful ways, even though\nwe might get hurt. Despite our fears of rejection, we decided to risk revealing\nourselves, our beliefs, and our needs. We decided to let down our defensive walls.\n\nThe freedom we've found has been worth the risk involved. We know there is still\nwork to do before we will be completely free of the barriers built by years of active\naddiction. But by reaching out to other addicts and allowing them to reach out to us,\ndespite our human failings, we have come to know that we have a great capacity for\nlove and intimacy.

As\nwe recover, new opportunities to surrender present themselves. We can either\nstruggle with everyone and everything we encounter or we can recall the benefits of\nour first surrender and stop fighting.\n\nMost of the pain we experience comes from fighting, not surrendering.

Can we look back at our lives and see\nthat we were not just \"lucky\"? Our experience in recovery, too, gives us examples of\na Higher Power working for our good.\n\nWhen we can look back at the evidence of a loving Higher Power acting on our\nbehalf, it becomes possible to trust that this Higher Power will continue to help us in\nthe future.

When driven primarily by self-will,\nwe constantly wondered whether we'd covered all the bases, whether we'd\nmanipulated that person in just the right way to achieve our ends, whether we'd\nmissed a critical detail in our efforts to control and manage the world. We either felt\nafraid, fearing our schemes would fail; angry or self-pitying when they fell through;\nor guilty when we pulled them off. It was hard, living on self-will, but we didn't know\nany other way.\n\nNot that surrender is always easy. On the contrary, surrender can be difficult,\nespecially in the beginning. Still, it's easier to trust God, a Power capable of\nmanaging our lives, than to trust only ourselves, whose lives are unmanageable. And\nthe more we surrender, the easier it gets.\n\nWhen we turn our will and our lives over to the care of our Higher Power, all we have\nto do is our part, as responsibly and conscientiously as we can.

It's important that we remain open-\nminded when others point out our shortcomings, for they are bringing to light\nopportunities for us to change and grow. Reacting defensively limits our ability to\nreceive the help they are offering us; letting go of our defenses opens the door to\nchange, growth, and new freedom.\n\nEach day in the recovery process will bring an opportunity for further change and\ngrowth.

In NA, it is easy to become a \"big fish in a little pond\". Our\ncontrolling attitude can easily drive away the newcomer.\n\nGroup conscience is one of the most important principles in service. It is vital to\nremember that the group conscience is what counts, not just our individual beliefs\nand desires. We lend our thoughts and beliefs to the development of a group\nconscience. Then when that conscience arises, we accept its guidance. The key is\nworking with others, not against them. If we remember that we strive together to\ndevelop a collective conscience, we will see that all sides have equal merit. When all\nthe discussions are over, all sides will come back together to carry a unified\nmessage.\n\nIt is often tempting to think that we know what is best for the group.

And as we watch the message take hold, we realize something else.\n\nIt's the message that brings recovery, not the messenger. A Higher Power, not our\nown power, is the source of the change that begins when we carry the message to a\nstill-suffering addict. As the message does its work, transforming the life of another\naddict, we see a Higher Power in action. We watch as acceptance and hope replace\ndenial and despair. Before our very eyes, the first traces of honesty, open-\nmindedness, and willingness begin to appear. Something's happening inside this\nperson, something bigger and more powerful than either of us.

Rather than\nsidestep the sensitivity many of us feel toward the word, let's address it head on.\n\nIt's true that Narcotics Anonymous is a spiritual program. Our Twelve Steps offer a\nway to find freedom from addiction through the help of a spiritual Power greater than\nwe are. The program, however, doesn't tell us anything about what we have to think\nabout that Power. In fact, over and over again, in our literature and our steps and\nour meetings, we hear it said, \"the God of our understanding\"-whatever that\nunderstanding may be.\n\nWe use the word \"God\" because it's used in our Basic Text and because it\ncommunicates most effectively to most people a basic understanding of the Power\nunderlying our recovery.

In recovery, one of the first things we strive to\ndevelop is a new attitude. We find that life goes a lot easier when we replace our\nnegative thinking with positive principles.\n\nWhile a negative attitude dogged us in our active addiction, all too often it can follow\nus into the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous. How can we begin to adjust our\nattitudes? By altering our actions. It isn't easy, but it can be done.\n\nWe can start by listening to the way we talk. Before we open our mouths, we ask\nourselves some simple questions: Does what I'm going to say speak to the problem,\nor the solution? Is what I'm going to say framed in a kind manner? Is what I have to\nsay important, or would everyone be just as well off if I kept my mouth shut? Am I\ntalking just to hear myself talk, or is there some purpose to my \"words of wisdom\"?\n\nOur attitudes are expressed in our actions.

The obsession and compulsion of our disease gave us a\n\"one-track\" way of thinking; when we wanted something, that's all we thought\nabout. And the drugs we took taught us that instant gratification was never more\nthan a dose away. It's no wonder that most of us came to Narcotics Anonymous with\nnext to no patience.\n\nThe problem is, we can't always get what we want whenever we want it. Some of our\nwishes are pure fantasy; if we think about it, we'll realize we have no reason to\nbelieve those wishes will be fulfilled in our lifetimes. we probably can't even fulfill all\nour realistic desires; we certainly can't fulfill them all at once. In order to acquire or\nachieve some things, we will have to sacrifice others.\n\nIn our addiction we sought instant gratification, squandering our resources. In\nrecovery we must learn to prioritize, sometimes denying the gratification of some\ndesires in order to fulfill more important long-term goals. To do so requires patience.\nTo find that patience, we practice our program of recovery, seeking the kind of full-\nbodied spiritual awakening that will allow us to live and enjoy life on life's terms.\n\nJust for today: Higher Power, help me discover what's most important in my life.\nHelp me learn patience, so that I can devote my resources to the important things.\n\n\n\n203\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

I should be\nbetter than this!\" But the reality of recovery is simple: whether we have thirty days\nor thirty years clean, we must be willing to ask for help when we need it.\n\nHumility is a common theme in our Twelve Steps. The program of Narcotics\nAnonymous is not about keeping up appearances. Instead, the program helps us get\nthe most from our recovery. We must be willing to lay bare our difficulties if we\nexpect to find solutions to problems that rise in our lives.\n\nThere's an old expression sometimes heard in Narcotics Anonymous: We can't save\nour face and our ass at the same time. It isn't easy to share in a meeting when we\nhave a number of years clean only to dissolve into tears because life on life's terms\nhas made us realize our powerlessness. But when the meeting ends and another\nmember comes up and says, \"You know, I really needed to hear what you had to\nsay,\" we know that there is a God working in our lives.\n\nThe taste of humility is never bitter.

Many of us have lived as if we believed we were the last people on earth, utterly\nblind to the effect our behavior has had on those around us.\n\nThe Eighth Step is the process our program has given us to honestly examine our\npast relationships.

When we recognize harm done\nto some of those people, we become willing to take responsibility for our actions by\nmaking amends to them.\n\nThe variety of people we encounter in our day and the quality of our relations with\nthem determines, to a great extent, the quality of our very lives.

Some of us may feel that our feelings of inferiority were where all our\nproblems began.\n\nWhether we learn this low self-esteem in our families or through our interactions\nwith others, in NA we learn the tools for reclaiming ourselves.

At the same time, the possibility of such\nintimacy causes us more fear than almost any other situation in life.\n\nIf we examine what frightens us, we'll usually find that we are attempting to hide an\naspect of our personalities that we are ashamed of, an aspect we sometimes haven't\neven admitted to ourselves. We don't want others to know of our insecurities, our\npain, or our neediness, so we simply refuse to expose them. We may imagine that if\nno one knows about our imperfections, those imperfections will cease to exist.\n\nThis is the point where our relationships stop. Anyone who enters our lives will not\nget past the point at which our secrets begin. To maintain intimacy in a relationship,\nit is essential that we acknowledge our defects and accept them. When we do, the\nfortress of denial, erected to keep these things hidden, will come crashing down,\nenabling us to build up our relationships with others.\n\nJust for today: I have opportunities to share my inner self.

We\ncome to see our failures as human mistakes. We realize that we will never be\nperfect, that we will, at times, disappoint ourselves and others. We hope for\nforgiveness.\n\nAs we learn to gently accept ourselves, we can start to view others with the same\naccepting and tolerant heart.

In our\naddiction, we examined ourselves as little as possible. We weren't happy with how\nwe were living our lives, but we didn't feel that we could change the way we lived.\nSelf-examination, we felt, would have been a painful exercise in futility.\n\nToday, all that is changing. Where we were powerless over our addiction, we've\nfound a Power greater than ourselves that has helped us stop using. Where we once\nfelt lost in life's maze, we've found guidance in the experience of our fellow\nrecovering addicts and our ever-improving contact with our Higher Power. We need\nnot feel trapped by our old, destructive patterns. We can live differently if we\nchoose.\n\nBy establishing a regular pattern of taking our own inventory, we give ourselves the\nopportunity to change anything in our lives that doesn't work. If we've started doing\nsomething that causes problems, we can start changing our behavior before it gets\ncompletely out of hand. And if we're doing something that prevents problems from\noccurring, we can take note of that, too, and encourage ourselves to keep doing\nwhat works.\n\nJust for today: I will make a commitment to include a regular inventory in my new\npattern of living.\n\n\n\n221\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

It is true that some\nof our members meet with financial success in recovery. They buy nice houses, drive\nnew cars, wear fine clothes, and form beautiful families. These outward signs of\nprosperity are not the lot of all of our members, however. A great many of us never\nachieve financial success. This does not necessarily reflect on the quality of our\nrecovery.\n\nWhen we are tempted to compare ourselves to these other, seemingly more affluent\nmembers, it is good to remember why we came to the rooms of Narcotics\nAnonymous.

One of\nthe more notorious forms of guilt is the self-loathing that results when we try to\nforgive ourselves but don't feel forgiven.\n\nHow can we forgive ourselves so we feel it? First, we remember that guilt and failure\nare not links in an unbreakable chain. Honestly sharing with a sponsor and with\nother addicts shows this to be true. Often the result of such sharing is a more\nsensible awareness of the part we ourselves have played in our affairs. Sometimes\nwe realize that our expectations have been too high. We increase our willingness to\nparticipate in the solutions rather than dwelling on the problems.\n\nSomewhere along the way, we discover who we really are.

We need not live up to or down to our illusions; we need only live in\nreality.\n\nJust for today: I am grateful for my assets and accept my liabilities.

Some of us twist our stories as a matter of\ncourse, even when we could just as easily tell the plain truth. Every time we try to\navoid being honest, it backfires on us. Honesty may be uncomfortable, but the\ntrouble we have to endure when we are dishonest is usually far worse than the\ndiscomfort of telling the truth.\n\nHonesty is one of the fundamental principles of recovery. We apply this principle\nright from the beginning of our recovery when we finally admit our powerlessness\nand unmanageability. We continue to apply the principle of honesty each time we are\nfaced with the option of either living in fantasy or living life on its own terms.\nLearning to be honest isn't always easy, especially after the covering up and\ndeception so many of us practiced in our addiction. Our voices may shake as we test\nour newfound honesty. But before long, the sound of the truth coming from our own\nmouths settles any doubts: Honesty feels good! It's easier living the truth than living\na lie.\n\nJust for today: I will honestly embrace life, with all its pressures and demands. I will\npractice honesty, even when it is awkward to do so.

Human beings are notoriously forgetful, unreliable, and\nimperfect. Most of us come from backgrounds where betrayal and insensitivity\namong friends were common occurrences. Even our most reliable friends weren't\nvery reliable. By the time we arrive at the doors of NA, most of us have hundreds of\nexperiences bearing out our conviction that people are untrustworthy. Yet our\nrecovery demands that we trust people. We are faced with this dilemma.\n\nPeople are not always trustworthy, yet we must trust them. How do we do that,\ngiven the evidence of our pasts?\n\nFirst, we remind ourselves that the rules of active addiction don't apply in recovery.\nMost of our fellow members are doing their level best to live by the spiritual\nprinciples we learn in the program. Second, we remind ourselves that we aren't\n100% reliable, either. We will surely disappoint someone in our lives, no matter how\nhard we try not to. Third, and most importantly, we realize that we need to trust our\nfellow members of NA.

We may hold onto such things\nbecause we don't want to surrender them. Yet if they're causing us shame, wouldn't\nwe live more easily with ourselves if we were rid of them?\n\nSome of us hold onto the things that cause us shame for another reason. It's not\nthat we don't want to be rid of them; we just don't believe we can be rid of them.\nThey've plagued us for so long, and we've tried so many times to rid ourselves of\nthem, that we've stopped hoping for relief. Yet still they shame us, and still we keep\nthem secret.\n\nWe need to remember who we are: recovering addicts. We who tried so long to keep\nour drug use a secret have found freedom from the obsession and compulsion to\nuse. Though many of us enjoyed using right to the end, we sought recovery anyway.\nWe just couldn't stand the toll our using was taking on us.

The spiritual ideals we find in recovery are\nrestoring the shape of our thoughts and our lives to their natural condition.\n\nAnd what is that \"natural condition\"? It is the condition we truly seek for ourselves, a\nreflection of our highest dreams. How do we know this? Because our thoughts are\nbeing shaped in recovery by the spiritual ideals we find in our developing relationship\nwith the God we've come to understand in NA.

A\npotential date has rejected us? Let's buy something. The dog has died? Let's go to\nthe mall. Problem is, emotional fulfillment can't be bought, not even on an easy\ninstallment plan.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with material things.

When\nwe've offered ourselves in service to others, without expectation of reward. We've\nfound true warmth in the fellowship of others-not only in NA, but in our families, our\nrelationships, and our communities. And we've found the surest source of\nsatisfaction in our conscious contact with our God.

Our active addiction was more than just a bad habit waiting to be broken by\nforce of will. Our addiction was a negative, draining dependence that stole all our\npositive energy. That dependence was so total; it prevented us from developing any\nkind of reliance on a Higher Power.\n\nFrom the very beginning of our recovery, our Higher Power has been the force that's\nbrought us freedom.

As\nusing addicts, we hid as much of the truth about ourselves from as much of the\nworld as we possibly could. Our fear kept us from opening ourselves up to those\naround us, providing protection against what others might do if we appeared\nvulnerable. But our fear also kept us from connecting with our world. We lived like\nalien beings on our own planet, always alone and getting lonelier by the minute.\n\nThe twelve Steps and the fellowship of recovering addicts give people like us a place\nwhere we can feel safe telling the truth about ourselves. We are able to honestly\nadmit our frustrating, humbling powerlessness over addiction because we meet\nmany others who've been in the same situation-we're safe among them. And we\nkeep on telling more of the truth about ourselves as we continue to work the steps.\nThe more we do, the more truly connected we feel to the world around us.\n\nToday, we need not hide from the reality of our relations with the people, places, and\nthings in our lives. We accept those relationships just as they are, and we own our\npart in them. We take time every day to ask, \"Am I telling the truth about myself?\"\nEach time we do this, we draw that much further away from the alienation that\ncharacterizes our addiction, and that much closer to the freedom recovery can bring\nus.\n\nJust for today: Truth is my connection to reality.

There, we can renew\ncontact with other recovering addicts, people who know what we're going through\nbecause they've been through it themselves. No day needs to go by without the\nrelief we get only from such fellowship.\n\nAs we mature in recovery, we get the same kinds of benefits from regular meeting\nattendance. Regardless of how long we've been clean, we never stop being addicts.\nTrue, we probably won't immediately start using mass quantities of drugs if we miss\nour meetings for a few days. But the more regularly we attend NA meetings, the\nmore we reinforce our identity as recovering addicts. And each meeting helps put us\nthat much further from becoming using addicts again.\n\nJust for today: I will make a commitment to include regular meeting attendance as a\npart of my new pattern of living.\n\n\n261\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",

We no longer live in isolation.\nBut freedom from isolation has its price:\n\nThe more we interact with people, the more often we'll find someone stepping on our\ntoes. And such are the circumstances in which resentments are often born.\n\nResentments, justified or not, are dangerous to our ongoing recovery. The longer we\nharbor resentments, the more bitter they become, eventually poisoning us. To stay\nclean, we must find the capacity to let go of our resentments, the capacity to forgive.\nWe first develop this capacity in working Steps Eight and Nine, and we keep it alive\nby regularly taking the Tenth Step. Sometimes when we are unwilling to forgive, it\nhelps to remember that we, too, may someday require another person's forgiveness.\nHaven't we all, at one time or another, done something that we deeply regretted?\nAnd aren't we healed in some measure when others accept our sincere amends?\n\nAn attitude of forgiveness is a little easier to develop when we remember that we are\nall doing the very best we can. And someday we, too, will need forgiveness.\n\nJust for today: I will let go of my resentments.

Our initial response to any type of\ndirection is often negative. Automatic rejection of authority seems to be a troubling\ncharacter defect for many addicts.\n\nA thorough self-examination can show us how we react to the world around us. We\ncan ask ourselves if our rebellion against people, places, and institutions is justified.\nIf we keep writing long enough, we can usually get past what others did and uncover\nour own part in our affairs. We find that what others did to us was not as important\nas how we responded to the situations we found ourselves in.\n\nRegular inventory allows us to examine the patterns in our reactions to life and see if\nwe are prone to chronic rebelliousness. Sometimes we will find that, while we may\nusually go along with what is suggested to us rather than risk rejection, we secretly\nharbor resentments against authority. If left to themselves, these resentments can\nlead us away from our program of recovery.\n\nThe inventory process allows us to uncover, evaluate, and alter our rebellious\npatterns. We can't change the world by taking an inventory, but we can change the\nway we react to it.\n\nJust for today: I want freedom from the turmoil of rebelliousness.

By\ncomparison, the recovering addicts we meet at meetings may seem almost\nsuperhumanly serene. These wise, loving people have many months, even years of\nliving in accordance with spiritual principles, giving of themselves to others without\nexpecting anything back. We trust them, allowing them to love us until we can love\nourselves.

We're crushed,\ndisillusioned-these recovering addicts aren't perfect after all! How can we possibly\ntrust them anymore?\n\nSomewhere between \"the heroes of recovery\" and \"the lousy NA bums\" lies the\ntruth: Our fellow addicts are neither completely bad nor completely good. After all, if\nthey were perfect, they wouldn't need this program. Our friends and sponsor are\nordinary recovering addicts, just like we are.

We struggled with the question, \"What can I do to make them feel\nbetter?\" We felt anxious and inadequate to relieve their suffering. We wished we had\nmore experience to share. We didn't know what to say.\n\nBut sometimes life deals wounds that can't be eased by even the most heartfelt\nwords.

Even too much was never enough! There was a spiritual emptiness inside us.\nThough we tried as hard as we could to fill that emptiness ourselves, we never\nsucceeded. In the end, we realized that we lacked the power to fill it; it would take a\nPower greater than ourselves to do that.\n\nSo we stopped using, and we stopped trying to fill the emptiness in our gut with\nthings.

No matter what\nmeasures we tried to make our lives better, we slid ever deeper into misery.\nAttempts we made to control our lives frequently met with failure. In a sense, our\nFirst Step admission of powerlessness was an acknowledgment of despair.\n\nSteps Two and Three lead us gradually out of that despair and into new hope, the\ncompanion of the recovering addict. Having accepted that so many of our efforts to\nchange have failed, we come to believe that there is a Power greater than ourselves.\nWe believe this Power can-and will-help us. We practice the Second and Third Steps\nas an affirmation of our hope for a better life, turning to this Power for guidance.

We were unwilling or\nunable to make choices about how we wanted to act, what we preferred to do, or\neven where we would live. We allowed the drugs or other people to make our most\nbasic decisions for us. Freedom from active addiction means, among other things,\nthe freedom to make those choices for ourselves.\n\nFreedom of choice is a wonderful gift, but it's also a great responsibility. Choice\nallows us to find out who we are and what we believe in. However, in exercising it,\nwe're called on to weigh our own choices and accept the consequences. This leads\nsome of us to seek out someone who will make our choices for us-our sponsor, our\nhome group, our NA friends-just as our disease made our choices for us when we\nwere using. That's not recovery.\n\nSeeking others' experience is one thing; abdicating personal responsibility is\nsomething else. If we don't use the gift of freedom we've been given, if we refuse to\naccept the responsibilities that go along with it, we'll lose that gift and our lives will\nbe diminished. We are responsible for our own recovery and our own choices.\nDifficult as it may seem; we must make those choices for ourselves and become\nwilling to accept the consequences.\n\nJust for today: I am grateful for the freedom to live as I choose.

When we hear this we usually laugh, too, but there's a nervous\nedge to our laughter. We wonder if all of our carefully laid plans are doomed to fail.\nIf we're planning a big event-a wedding, a return to school, or perhaps a career\nchange-we begin to wonder if our plans are the same as our Higher Power's plans.\nWe are capable of working ourselves into such a frenzy of worry over this question\nthat we refuse to make any plans at all.\n\nBut the simple fact is that we really don't know whether our Higher Power's plans for\nour lives are carved in stone or not. Most of us have opinions about fate and destiny\nbut, whether we believe in such theories or not, we still have a responsibility to live\nour lives and make plans for the future. If we refuse to accept responsibility for our\nlives, we're still making plans-plans for a shallow, boring existence.\n\nWhat we make in recovery are plans, not results. We'll never know whether the\nmarriage, the education, or the new job is going to work out until we try it. We\nsimply exercise our best judgment, check with our sponsor, pray, use all the\ninformation at hand, and make the most reasonable plans we can. For the rest, we\ntrust in the loving care of the God of our understanding, knowing that we've acted\nresponsibly.\n\nJust for today: I will make plans, but I will not plan the result. I will trust in my\nHigher Power's loving care.\n\n\n327\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",

We used because we were afraid to feel emotional or physical pain. Our\nfear of people and situations gave us a convenient excuse to use drugs. A few of us\nwere so afraid of everything that we were unable even to leave our homes without\nusing first.\n\nAs we stay clean, we replace our fear with a belief in the fellowship, the steps, and a\nHigher Power. As this belief grows, our faith in the miracle of recovery begins to\ncolor all aspects of our lives. We start to see ourselves differently. We realize we are\nspiritual beings, and we strive to live by spiritual principles.\n\nThe application of spiritual principles helps eliminate fear from our lives. By\nrefraining from treating other people in harmful or unlawful ways, we find we needn't\nfear how we will be treated in return. As we practice love, compassion,\nunderstanding, and patience in our relationships with others, we are treated in turn\nwith respect and consideration. We realize these positive changes result from\nallowing our Higher Power to work through us. We come to believe-not to think, but\nto believe-that our Higher Power wants only the best for us. No matter what the\ncircumstances, we find we can walk in faith instead of fear.\n\nJust for today: I no longer need to run in fear, but can walk in faith that my Higher\nPower has only the best in store for me.\n\n\n328\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "11-11": "From surrender to acceptance\n\n\"We surrender quietly and let the God of our understanding take care of us.\"\nBasic Text p. 26\n\nSurrender and acceptance are like infatuation and love. Infatuation begins when we\nencounter someone special. Infatuation requires nothing but the acknowledgement\nof the object of our infatuation. For infatuation to become love, however, requires a\ngreat deal of effort. That initial connection must be slowly, patiently nurtured into a\nlasting, durable bond.\n\nIt's the same with surrender and acceptance. We surrender when we acknowledge\nour powerlessness. Slowly, we come to believe that a Power greater than ourselves\ncan give us the care we need. Surrender turns to acceptance when we let this Power\ninto our lives. We examine ourselves and let our God see us as we are. Having\nallowed the God of our understanding access to the depths of ourselves, we accept\nmore of God's care. We ask this Power to relieve us of our shortcomings and help us\namend the wrongs we've done. Then, we embark on a new way of life, improving our\nconscious contact and accepting our Higher Power's continuing care, guidance, and\nstrength.\n\nSurrender, like infatuation, can be the beginning of a lifelong relationship. To turn\nsurrender into acceptance, however, we must let the God of our understanding take\ncare of us each day.\n\nJust for today: My recovery is more than infatuation. I have surrendered. Today, I\nwill nurture my conscious contact with my Higher Power and accept that Power's\ncontinuing care for me.\n\n\n329\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",

When we stop\nand think, we realize that we expected recovery would make us perfect. We didn't\nexpect to continue making many mistakes. But we do. That's not the addict side of\nus showing through; that's being human.\n\nIn Narcotics Anonymous we strive for recovery, not perfection. The only promise we\nare given is freedom from active addiction. Perfection is not an attainable state for\nhuman beings; it's not a realistic goal. What we often seek in perfection is freedom\nfrom the discomfort of making mistakes. In return for that freedom from discomfort,\nwe trade our curiosity, our flexibility, and the room to grow.\n\nWe can consider the trade: Do we want to live the rest of our lives in our well-\ndefined little world, safe but perhaps stifled? Or do we wish to venture out into the\nunknown, take a risk, and reach for everything life has to offer?\n\nJust for today: I want all that life has to offer me and all that recovery can provide.\nToday, I will take a risk, try something new, and grow.\n\n\n331\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",

When we\nseek advice about situations that trouble us, we often find that our Higher Power\nworks through others. When we accept that we don't have all the answers, we open\nourselves to new and different options. A willingness to let go of our preconceived\nideas and opinions opens the channel for spiritual guidance to light our way.\n\nAt times, we must be driven to the point of distraction before we are ready to turn\ndifficult situations over to our Higher Power.

To feel the closeness intimacy brings, we\nmust allow others to get close to us-the real us.\n\nIf we are to share our innermost selves with others, we must first have an idea of\nwhat those innermost selves are truly like. We regularly examine our lives to find out\nwho we really are, what we really want, and how we really feel. Then, based on our\nregular inventories of ourselves, we must be as completely and consistently honest\nwith our friends as we can be.\n\nIntimacy is a part of life, and therefore a part of living clean-and intimacy, like\neverything in recovery, has its price. The painstaking self-scrutiny intimacy calls for\ncan be hard work. And the total honesty of intimacy often brings its own\ncomplications. But the freedom from isolation and loneliness that intimacy brings is\nwell worth the effort.\n\nJust for today: I seek the freedom from isolation and loneliness that intimacy brings.\nToday, I will get to know \"the real me\" by taking a personal inventory, and I will\npractice being completely honest with another person.\n\n\n348\n\nJust For Today\nDaily Meditations for Recovering Addicts",
  "12-01": "Life's rewards\n\n\"We begin to pray only for God's will for us. That way, we get only what we are\ncapable of handling.\"\nBasic Text p. 47\n\nImagine what might happen if God gave us everything we wanted. A fabulous new\ncar, straight A's, a triple salary raise - all ours without effort, just for the asking.\n\nNow imagine the problems that come along with unearned riches, new luxury cars,\nand unmerited scholastic recognition. What would we do with a huge salary raise\nthat had been granted for no reason? How would we handle our new financial\nresponsibilities? And how would we live up to that raise? Could we ever make it\nappear that we deserve such pay when we know we don't?\n\nWhat about that fantastic new car? Most come with expensive insurance premiums\nand hefty maintenance costs. Are we prepared to care for what we've asked for?\n\nAcademic honors? Could we perform like A students after we'd been given high\nmarks we hadn't earned? What would we do if we were exposed as frauds?\n\nWhen we talk to God, we need to remember that we live in the real world. We earn\nrewards and learn to handle them as we do. Confining our prayers to requests for\nknowledge of God's will, the power to carry it out, and the ability to live with the\nconsequences will ensure that we get no more than we can handle.\n\nJust for today: I will pray only for knowledge of God's will and the power to carry\nthat out in the real world.\n\n\n350\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-02": "Recovery: our first priority\n\n\"We have to keep our recovery first and our priorities in order\"\nBasic Text p. 79\n\nBefore coming to NA, we used many excuses to justify our use of drugs: \"He yelled\nat me.\" \"She said this.\" \"My partner left.\" \"I got fired.\" We used these same excuses\nfor not seeking help for our drug problem. We had to realize that these things kept\nhappening because we kept using drugs. Only when we made recovery our first\npriority did these situations begin to change.\n\nWe may be subject to the same tendency today, using excuses for not attending\nmeetings and being of service. Our current excuses may be of a different nature: \"I\ncan't leave my kids.\" \"My vacation wore me out.\" \"I have to finish this project so I\ncan impress my boss.\" But still, if we don't make recovery our first priority, chances\nare that we won't have to worry about these excuses anymore. Kids, vacations, and\njobs probably won't be in our lives if we relapse.\n\nOur recovery must come first. Job or no job, relationship or no relationship, we have\nto attend meetings, work the steps, call our sponsor, and be of service to God and\nothers. These simple actions are what make it possible for us to have vacations,\nfamilies, and bosses to worry about. Recovery is the foundation of our lives, making\neverything else possible.\n\nJust for today: I will keep my priorities in order. Number One on the list is my\nrecovery.\n\n\n351\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-03": "Vision without limits\n\n\"Perhaps for the first time, we see a vision of our new life.\"\nBasic Text p. 34\n\nIn our addiction, our vision of ourselves was very limited. Each day, we went through\nthe same routine: getting, using, and finding ways and means to get more. And\nthat's all we could reasonably expect for the duration of our lives. Our potential was\nlimited.\n\nToday, our prospects are changed. Recovery has given us a new vision of ourselves\nand our lives. We are no longer trapped in the endlessly gray routine of addiction.\nWe are free to stretch ourselves in new ways, trying out new ideas and new\nactivities. In doing so, we come to see ourselves in a new way. Our potential is\nlimited only by the strength of the Higher Power that cares for us-and that strength\nhas no limits.\n\nIn recovery, life and everything in it appears open to us. Guided by our spiritual\nprinciples, driven by the power given us by the God of our understanding, our\nhorizons are limitless.\n\nJust for today: I will open my eyes to the possibilities before me. My potential is as\nlimitless and as powerful as the God of my understanding. Today, I will act on that\npotential.\n\n\n352\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-04": "God's will, not ours\n\n\"We know that if we pray for God's will we will receive what is best for us, regardless\nof what we think.\"\nBasic Text p. 44\n\nBy the time we came to NA, our inner voices had become unreliable and self-\ndestructive. Addiction had warped our desires, our interests, our sense of what was\nbest for ourselves. That's why it's been so important in recovery to develop our belief\nin a Power greater than ourselves, something that could provide saner, more reliable\nguidance than our own. We've begun learning how to rely on this Power's care and to\ntrust the inner direction it provides us.\n\nAs with all learning processes, it takes practice to \"pray only for knowledge of God's\nwill for us and the power to carry that out.\" The selfish, ego-driven attitudes we\ndeveloped in our addiction are not cast off overnight. Those attitudes may affect the\nway we pray. We may even find ourselves praying something like, \"Relieve me of\nthis character defect so I can look good.\"\n\nThe more straightforward we are about our own ideas and desires, the easier it will\nbe to distinguish between our own will and our Higher Power's will. \"Just for your\ninformation, God\" we might pray, \"here's what I want in this situation. Nonetheless,\nI ask that your will, not mine, be done.\" Once we do this, we are prepared to\nrecognize and accept our Higher Power's guidance.\n\nJust for today: Higher Power, I've learned to trust your guidance, yet I still have my\nown ideas about how I want to live my life. Let me share those ideas with you, and\nthen let me clearly understand your will for me. In the end, let your will, not mine,\nbe done.\n\n\n353\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-05": "Those who want to recover\n\n\"We have seen the program work for any addict who honestly and sincerely wants to\nstop [using drugs]\"\nBasic Text p. 10\n\nHow do we know when someone honestly and sincerely wants to stop using drugs?\nThe truth is that we don't know! Because we cannot read minds or know another's\nmotives and desires, we simply have to hope for the best. We may talk to a\nnewcomer at a meeting and think we'll never see them again, only to find them\nseveral years later doing well in their recovery. We may be tempted to give up on\nsomeone who keeps relapsing or doesn't get clean right away, but we must not. No\nmatter how unwilling someone may seem, a simple fact remains-the addict is at a\nmeeting.\n\nWe may never know the results of our Twelfth Step work; it is not up to us to gauge\nthe willingness of a newcomer. The message we carry is a part of us. We carry it\neverywhere and share it freely, leaving the results to a Power greater than\nourselves.\n\nJust for today: I will share my recovery with any addict, anywhere, anytime, and\nunder any circumstances. I will leave the results to my Higher Power.\n\n\n354\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-06": "Romance and recovery\n\n\"Relationships can be a terribly painful area.\"\nBasic Text p. 78\n\nLove is like an elixir for some of us. The excitement of a new lover, the intrigue of\nexploring intimacy, the sense of release we get from allowing ourselves to become\nvulnerable-these are all powerful emotions. But we can't forget that we have only a\ndaily reprieve from our addiction. Holding onto this daily reprieve must be the top\npriority in any recovering addict's life.\n\nWe can become too involved in our relationship. We can neglect old friends and our\nsponsor in the process. Then, when things get difficult, we often feel that we can no\nlonger reach out to those who helped us prior to our romantic involvement. This\nbelief can lay the groundwork for a relapse. By consistently working our program and\nattending meetings, we ensure that we have a network of recovery, even when we're\ndeep in a romance.\n\nOur desire to be romantically involved is natural. But we mustn't forget that, without\nour program, even the healthiest relationship will not guard us against the strength\nof our addiction.\n\nJust for today: In my desire for romance, I will not ignore my recovery.\n\n\n355\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-07": "Surviving our emotions\n\n\"We use the tools available to us and develop the ability to survive our emotions.\"\nBasic Text p. 30\n\n\"Survive my emotions?\" some of us say. \"You've got to be kidding!\" When we were\nusing, we never gave ourselves the chance to learn how to survive them. You don't\nsurvive your feelings, we thought-you drug them. The problem was, that \"cure\" for\nour unsurvivable emotions was killing us. That's when we came to Narcotics\nAnonymous, started working the Twelve Steps and, as a result, began to mature\nemotionally.\n\nMany of us found emotional relief right from the start. We were tired of pretending\nthat our addiction and our lives were under control; it actually felt good to finally\nadmit they weren't. After sharing our inventory with our sponsor, we began to feel\nlike we didn't have to deny who we were or what we felt in order to be accepted.\nWhen we'd finished making our amends, we knew we didn't have to suffer with guilt;\nwe could own up to it and it wouldn't kill us. The more we worked the NA program,\nthe better we felt about living life as it came to us.\n\nThe program works today as well as it ever did. By taking stock of our day, getting\nhonest about our part in it, and surrendering to reality, we can survive the feelings\nlife throws our way. By using the tools available to us, we've developed the ability to\nsurvive our emotions.\n\nJust for today: I will not deny my feelings. I will practice honesty and surrender to\nlife as it is. I will use the tools of this program to survive my emotions.\n\n\n356\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-08": "Calling a defect a defect\n\n\"When we see how our defects exist in our lives and accept them, we can let go of\nthem and get on with our new life.\"\nBasic Text p. 33-34\n\nSometimes our readiness to have our character defects removed depends on what\nwe call them. If misnaming our defects makes them seem less \"defective\" we may\nbe unable to see the damage they cause. And if they seem to be causing no harm,\nwhy would we ever ask our Higher Power to remove them from our lives?\n\nTake \"people pleasing\" for example. Doesn't really sound all that bad, does it? It just\nmeans we're nice to people, right? Not quite. To put it bluntly, it means we're\ndishonest and manipulative. We lie about our feelings, our beliefs, and our needs,\ntrying to soothe others into compliance with our wishes.\n\nOr perhaps we think we're \"easygoing.\" But does \"easygoing\" mean we ignore our\nhousework, avoid confrontations, and stay put in a comfortable rut? Then a better\nname for it would be \"laziness\" or \"procrastination\" or \"fear\".\n\nMany of us have trouble identifying our character defects. If this is the case for us,\nwe can talk with our sponsor or our NA friends. We clearly and honestly describe our\nbehavior to them and ask for their help in identifying our defects. As time passes,\nwe'll become progressively better able to identify our own character defects, calling\nthem by their true names.\n\nJust for today: I will call my defects by their true names. If I have trouble doing this,\nI will ask my sponsor for help.\n\n\n357\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-09": "Listening\n\n\"This ability to listen is a gift and grows as we grow spiritually. Life takes on a new\nmeaning when we open ourselves to this gift.\"\nBasic Text p. 102\n\nHave you ever watched two small children carry on a conversation? One will be\ntalking about purple dragons while the other carries on about the discomfort caused\nby having sand in one's shoes. We sometimes encounter the same communication\nproblems as we learn to listen to others. We may struggle through meetings, trying\ndesperately to hear the person sharing while our minds are busy planning what we\nwill say when it's our turn to speak. In conversation, we may suddenly realize that\nour answers have nothing to do with the questions we're being asked. They are,\ninstead, speeches prepared while in the grip of our self-obsession.\n\nLearning how to listen-really listen-is a difficult task, but one that's not beyond our\nreach. We might begin by acknowledging in our replies what our conversational\npartner is saying. We might ask if there is anything we can do to help when someone\nexpresses a problem. With a little practice, we can find greater freedom from self-\nobsession and closer contact with the people in our lives.\n\nJust for today: I will quiet my own thoughts and listen to what someone else is\nsaying.\n\n\n358\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-10": "Winners\n\n\"I started to imitate some of the things the winners were doing. I got caught up in\nNA. I felt good....\"\nBasic Text p. 223\n\nWe often hear it said in meetings that we should \"stick with the winners.\" Who are\nthe winners in Narcotics Anonymous? Winners are easily identified. They work an\nactive program of recovery, living in the solution and staying out of the problem.\nWinners are always ready to reach their hands out to the newcomer. They have\nsponsors and work with those sponsors. Winners stay clean, just for today.\n\nWinners are recovering addicts who keep a positive frame of mind. They may be\ngoing through troubled times, but they still attend meetings and share openly about\nit. Winners know in their hearts that, with the help of a Higher Power, nothing will\ncome along that is too much to handle.\n\nWinners strive for unity in their service efforts. Winners practice putting \"principles\nbefore personalities.\" Winners remember the principle of anonymity, doing the\nprincipled action no matter who is involved. Winners keep a sense of humor. Winners\nhave the ability to laugh at themselves. And when winners laugh, they laugh with\nyou, not at you.\n\nWho are the winners in Narcotics Anonymous? Any one of us can be considered a\nwinner. All of us exhibit some of the traits of the winner; sometimes we come very\nclose to the ideal, sometimes we don't. If we are clean today and working our\nprogram to the best of our ability, we are winners!\n\nJust for today: I will strive to fulfill my ideals. I will be a winner.\n\n\n359\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-11": "Misery is optional\n\n\"No one is forcing us to give up our misery.\"\nBasic Text p. 29\n\nIt's funny to remember how reluctant we once were to surrender to recovery. We\nseemed to think we had wonderful, fulfilling lives as using addicts and that giving up\nour drugs would be worse than serving a life sentence at hard labor. In reality, the\nopposite was true: Our lives were miserable, but we were afraid to trade that\nfamiliar misery for the uncertainties of recovery.\n\nIt's possible to be miserable in recovery, too, though it's not necessary. No one will\nforce us to work the steps, go to meetings, or work with a sponsor. There is no NA\nmilitia that will force us to do the things that will free us from pain. But we do have a\nchoice. We've already chosen to give up the misery of active addiction for the sanity\nof recovery. Now, if we're ready to exchange today's misery for even greater peace,\nwe have a means to do just that-if we really want to.\n\nJust for today: I don't have to be miserable unless I really want to be. Today, I will\ntrade in my misery for the benefits of recovery.\n\n\n360\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-12": "Fear of change\n\n\"By working the steps, we come to accept a Higher Power's will.... We lose our fear\nof the unknown. We are set free.\"\nBasic Text p. 16\n\nLife is a series of changes, both large and small. Although we may know and accept\nthis fact intellectually, chances are that our initial emotional reaction to change is\nfear. For some reason, we assume that each and every change is going to hurt,\ncausing us to be miserable.\n\nIf we look back on the changes that have happened in our lives, we'll find that most\nof them have been for the best. We were probably very frightened at the prospect of\nlife without drugs, yet it's the best thing that's ever happened to us. Perhaps we've\nlost a job that we thought we'd die without, but later on we found greater challenge\nand personal fulfillment in a new career. As we venture forth in our recovery, we're\nlikely to experience more changes. We will outgrow old situations and become ready\nfor new ones.\n\nWith all sorts of changes taking place, it's only natural to grab hold of something,\nanything familiar and try to hold on. Solace can be found in a Power greater than\nourselves. The more we allow changes to happen at the direction of our Higher\nPower, the more we'll trust that those changes are for the best. Faith will replace\nfear, and we'll know in our hearts that all will be well.\n\nJust for today: When I am afraid of a change in my life, I will take comfort from\nknowing that God's will for me is good.\n\n\n361\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",

Many people we\nencounter from all walks of life-our family members, old friends, and co-workers-\ncould really use a program of recovery in their lives. Sadly, those who need us don't\nalways find their way to our rooms.\n\nNA is a program of attraction, not promotion. We are only members when we say we\nare. We can bring our friends and loved ones to a meeting if they are willing, but we\ncannot force them to embrace the way of life that has given us freedom from active\naddiction.\n\nMembership in Narcotics Anonymous is a highly personal decision. The choice to\nbecome a member is made in the heart of each individual addict. In the long run,\ncoerced meeting attendance doesn't keep too many addicts in our rooms. Only\naddicts who are still suffering, if given the opportunity, can decide if they are\npowerless over their addiction.

  "12-14": "Addiction, drugs, and recovery\n\n\"Addiction is a physical, mental, and spiritual disease that affects every area of our\nlives.\"\nBasic Text p. 20\n\nBefore we started using, most of us had a stereotype, a mental image of what\naddicts were supposed to look like. Some of us pictured a junkie robbing\nconvenience markets for drug money. Others imagined a paranoid recluse peering at\nlife from behind perpetually drawn drapes and locked doors. As long as we didn't fit\nany of the stereotypes, we thought, we couldn't be addicts.\n\nAs our using progressed, we discarded those misconceptions about addiction, only to\ncome up with another: the idea that addiction was about drugs. We may have\nthought addiction meant a physical habit, believing any drug that didn't produce\nphysical habituation was not \"addictive.\" Or we thought the drugs we took were\ncausing all our problems. We thought that merely getting rid of the drugs would\nrestore sanity to our lives.\n\nOne of the most important lessons we learn in Narcotics Anonymous is that addiction\nis much more than the drugs we used. Addiction is a part of us; it's an illness that\ninvolves every area of our lives, with or without drugs. We can see its effects on our\nthoughts, our feelings, and our behavior, even after we stop using. Because of this,\nwe need a solution that works to repair every area of our lives: the Twelve Steps.\n\nJust for today: Addiction is not a simple disease, but it has a simple solution.

By helping others to stay clean, we enjoy the benefit\nof the spiritual wealth that we have found.\"\nBasic Text p. 47\n\nTime and again in our recovery, others have freely shared with us what was freely\nshared with them. Perhaps we were the recipients of a Twelfth Step call. Maybe\nsomeone picked us up and took us to our first meeting. It could be that someone\nbought us dinner when we were new. All of us have been given time, attention, and\nlove by our fellow members. We may have asked someone, \"What can I do to repay\nyou?\" And the answer we received was probably a suggestion that we do the same\nfor a newer member when we were able.\n\nAs we maintain our clean time and recovery, we find ourselves wanting to do for\nothers the things that someone did for us, and happy that we can. If we heard the\nmessage while in a hospital or institution, we can join our local H&I subcommittee.\nPerhaps we can volunteer on the NA help line.

In our early days of recovery, they were\nalmost always a surprise! We've learned to check our motives through prayer,\nmeditation, the steps, and talking to our sponsor or other addicts. When we find\nourselves with an especially strong urge to do or have something, it's particularly\nimportant to check our motives to find out what we really want.\n\nIn early recovery, many of us throw ourselves into service with great fervor before\nwe have started the regular practice of motive-checking. It takes awhile before we\nbecome aware of the real reasons for our zeal. We may want to impress others,\nshow off our talents, or be recognized and important. Now, these desires may not be\nharmful in another setting, expressed through another outlet. In NA service,\nhowever, they can do serious damage.\n\nWhen we decide to serve NA, we make a decision to help addicts find and maintain\nrecovery. We have to carefully check our motives in service, remembering that it's\nmuch easier to frighten away using addicts than to convince them to stay. When we\nshow them game-playing, manipulation, or pomposity, we present an unattractive\npicture of recovery; however, the unselfish desire to serve others creates an\natmosphere that is attractive to the addict who still suffers.\n\nJust for today: I will check my motives for the true spirit of service.\n\n\n366\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",

Discussions of current controversies have their place-however; it's not at\nan NA meeting.\n\nThose times when we grow disgusted with meetings and find ourselves complaining\nthat \"they don't know how to share\" or \"it was another whining session\" are probably\nindications that we need to take a good, hard look at how we share.\n\nWhat we share about how we got into recovery and how we stayed here through\npracticing the Twelve Steps is the real message of recovery. That's what we are all\nlooking for when we go to a meeting.

If we talk about recovery at\nmeetings but continue to live as we did in active addiction, our fellow members may\nsuspect that we are doing nothing more than quoting bumper stickers.\n\nWhat we pass on to newer members comes more from how we live than what we\nsay.

We sometimes become overwhelmed when contemplating how far short we\nfall of our ideals, so overwhelmed that we fear there's no chance of becoming the\npeople we'd like to be. That's when our defense mechanism of denial kicks in, taking\nus to the opposite extreme: nothing about ourselves needs changing, we tell\nourselves, so why worry? Neither extreme gives us the freedom to change.\n\nWhether we are long-time NA members or new to recovery, the freedom to change is\nacquired by working the Twelve Steps. When we admit our powerlessness and the\nunmanageability of our lives, we counteract the lie that says we don't have to\nchange. In coming to believe that a Power greater than we are can help us, we lose\nour fear that we are damaged beyond repair; we come to believe we can change. We\nturn ourselves over to the care of the God of our understanding and tap the strength\nwe need to make a thorough, honest examination of ourselves. We admit to God, to\nourselves, and to another human being what we've found. We accept the good and\nthe bad in ourselves; with this acceptance, we become free to change.\n\nJust for today: I want to change. By working the steps, I will counter fear and denial\nand find the acceptance needed to change.\n\n\n370\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-22": "A new way to live\n\n\"When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer function as a human\nbeing, either with or without drugs, we all face the same dilemma.... Either go on as\nbest we can to the bitter ends-jails, institutions, or death-or find a new way to live.\"\nBasic Text p.84\n\nWhat was the worst aspect of active addiction? For many of us, it wasn't the chance\nthat we might die some day of our disease. The worst part was the living death we\nexperienced every day, the never-ending meaninglessness of life. We felt like\nwalking ghosts, not living, loving parts of the world around us.\n\nIn recovery, we've come to believe that we're here for a reason: to love ourselves\nand to love others. In working the Twelve Steps, we have learned to accept\nourselves. With that self-acceptance has come self-respect. We have seen that\neverything we do has an effect on others; we are a part of the lives of those around\nus, and they of ours. We've begun to trust other people and to acknowledge our\nresponsibility to them.\n\nIn recovery, we've come back to life. We maintain our new lives by contributing to\nthe welfare of others and seeking each day to do that better-that's where the Tenth,\nEleventh, and Twelfth Steps come in. The days of living like a ghost are past, but\nonly so long as we actively seek to be healthy, loving, contributing parts of our own\nlives and the lives of others around us.\n\nJust for today: I have found a new way to live. Today, I will seek to serve others\nwith love and to love myself.\n\n\n371\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-23": "New ideas\n\n\"We reevaluate our old ideas so we can become acquainted with the new ideas that\nlead to a new way of life.\"\nBasic Text p.91\n\nLearning to live a new way of life can be difficult. Sometimes, when the going gets\nespecially hard, we're tempted to follow the path of least resistance and live by our\nold ideas again. We forget that our old ideas were killing us. To live a new way of\nlife, we need to open our minds to new ideas.\n\nWorking the steps, attending meetings, sharing with others, trusting a sponsor -\nthese suggestions may meet our resistance, even our rebellion. The NA program\nrequires effort, but each step in the program brings us closer to becoming the kinds\nof people we truly want to be. We want to change, to grow, to become something\nmore than we are today. To do that, we open our minds, try on the new ideas we've\nfound in NA, and learn to live a new way of life.\n\nJust for today: I will open my mind to new ideas and learn to live my life in a new\nway.\n\n\n372\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-24": "The group\n\n\"The Twelfth Step of our personal program also says that we carry the message to\nthe addict who still suffers.... The group is the most powerful vehicle we have for\ncarrying the message.\"\nBasic Text p.65\n\nWhen we first come to Narcotics Anonymous meetings, we meet recovering addicts.\nWe know they are addicts because they talk about the same experiences and\nfeelings we've had. We know they are recovering because of their serenity-they've\ngot something we want. We feel hope when other addicts share their recovery with\nus in NA meetings.\n\nThe atmosphere of recovery attracts us to the meetings. That atmosphere is created\nwhen group members make a commitment to work together. We try to enhance the\natmosphere of recovery by helping set up for meetings, greeting newcomers, and\ntalking with other addicts after the meeting. These demonstrations of our\ncommitment make our meetings attractive and help our groups share their recovery.\n\nSharing experience in meetings is one way in which we help one another, and it's\noften the foundation for our sense of belonging. We identify with other addicts, so we\ntrust their message of hope. Many of us would not have stayed in Narcotics\nAnonymous without that sense of belonging and hope. When we share at group\nmeetings, we support our personal recovery while helping others.\n\nJust for today: I will reach out to another addict in my group and share my recovery.\n\n\n373\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-25": "Anonymity and self-will\n\n\"The drive for personal gain... which brought so much pain in the past falls by the\nwayside if we adhere to the principle of anonymity\"\nBasic Text p.73\n\nThe word anonymity itself means namelessness, but there's a larger principle at\nwork in the anonymity of the NA program: the principle of selflessness. When we\nadmit our powerlessness to manage our own lives, we take our first step away from\nself-will and our first step toward selflessness. The less we try to run our lives on\nself-will, the more we find the power and direction once so sorely lacking in our lives.\n\nBut the principle of selflessness does a lot more than just make us feel better-it\nhelps us live better. Our ideas of how the world should be run begin to lose their\nimportance, and we stop trying to impose our will on everyone and everything\naround us. And when we abandon our \"know-it-all\" pretensions and start recognizing\nthe value of other peoples' experience, we start treating them with respect. The\ninterests of others become as important to us as our own; we start to think about\nwhat's best for the group, rather than just what's best for us. We start living a life\nthat's bigger than we are, that's more than just us, our name, ourselves - we start\nliving the principle of anonymity.\n\nJust for today: God, please free me from self-will. Help me understand the principle\nof anonymity; help me to live selflessly.\n\n\n374\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-26": "Never-Failing Power\n\n\"As we learn to trust this Power, we begin to overcome our fear of life.\"\nBasic Text p.24\n\nWe are people accustomed to placing all our eggs in one basket. Many of us had one\nparticular drug of choice that was our favorite. We relied on it to get us through each\nday and make life bearable. We were faithful to that drug; in fact, we committed\nourselves to it without reservation. And then it turned on us. We had been betrayed\nby the only thing we had ever depended on, and the betrayal left us floundering.\n\nNow that we've stumbled into the rooms of recovery, we may be tempted to rely on\nanother human being to meet our needs. We may expect this from our sponsor, our\nlover, or our best friend. But dependence on human beings is risky. They fall short of\nperfection. They may be on vacation, sleeping, or in a bad mood when we need\nthem.\n\nOur dependence must rest on a Power greater than ourselves. No human force can\nrestore our sanity, care for our will and our lives, or be unconditionally available and\nloving whenever we are in need. We place our trust in the God of our understanding,\nfor only that Power will never fail us.\n\nJust for today: I will place my trust in a Power greater than myself, for only that\nPower will never let me down.\n\n\n375\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-27": "God could restore us to sanity\n\n\"The process of coming to believe restores us to sanity. The strength to move into\naction comes from this belief.\"\nBasic Text pg. 24\n\nNow that we've finally admitted our insanity and seen examples of it in all its\nmanifestations, we might be tempted to believe that we are doomed to repeat this\nbehavior for the rest of our lives. Just as we thought that our active addiction was\nhopeless and we'd never get clean, we might now believe that our particular brand of\ninsanity is hopeless.\n\nNot so! We know that we owe our freedom from active addiction to the grace of a\nloving God. If our Higher Power can perform such a miracle as relieving our\nobsession to use drugs, surely this Power can also relieve our insanity in all its\nforms.\n\nIf we doubt this, all we have to do is think about the sanity that has already been\nrestored to our lives. Maybe we've gotten carried away with our credit cards, but\nsanity returns when we admit defeat and cut them all up. Perhaps we've been feeling\nlonely and want to go visit our old using buddies. Going to visit our sponsor instead\nis a sane act.\n\nThe insanity of our addiction recedes into the past as we begin experiencing\nmoments of sanity in our recovery. Our belief in a Power greater than ourselves\ngrows as we begin to understand that even our brand of insanity is nothing in the\nface of this Power.\n\nJust for today: I thank the God of my understanding for each sane act in my life, for\nI know they are indications of my restoration to sanity.\n\n\n376\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-28": "Depression\n\n\"We are no longer fighting fear anger guilt, self-pity, or depression.\"\nBasic Text p.26\n\nAs addicts, many of us experience depression from time to time. When we feel\ndepressed, we may be tempted to isolate ourselves. However, if we do this, our\ndepression may turn to despair. We can't afford to let depression lead us back to\nusing.\n\nInstead, we try to go about the routine of our lives. We make meeting attendance\nand contact with our sponsor top priorities. Sharing with others about our feelings\nmay let us know we aren't the only ones who have been depressed in recovery.\nWorking with a newcomer can work wonders for our own state of mind. And, most\nimportantly, prayer and meditation can help us tap the power we need to survive\ndepression.\n\nWe practice acceptance and remember that feelings like depression will\nunquestionably pass in time. Rather than struggle with our feelings, we accept them\nand ask for the strength to walk through them.\n\nJust for today: I accept that my feelings of depression won't last forever. I will talk\nopenly about my feelings with my sponsor or another person who understands.\n\n\n377\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-29": "Through others' eyes\n\n\"When someone points out a shortcoming, our first reaction may be\ndefensive....[But] if we truly want to be free, we will take a good look at input from\nfellow addicts.\"\nBasic Text p.35\n\nAt some point in our recovery, we come to the awkward realization that the way we\nsee ourselves is not necessarily the way others do. We are probably neither as bad,\nas good, as beautiful, or as ugly as we think we are-but we are too close to ourselves\nto really tell for sure. That's where our friends in the program come in, caring\nenough to share with us what they see when they look in our direction. They tell us\nthe good things about ourselves we might not know-and they tell us the hard things,\ntoo, that we might not be able to see.\n\nWe may react defensively to such \"help\"-and, in some cases, justly so. However,\neven malicious remarks about our supposed shortcomings can shed light on aspects\nof our recovery that we cannot see ourselves. Wherever a useful insight comes from,\nfor whatever reason it is offered, we cannot afford to discount it.\n\nWe don't need to wait for others to spontaneously offer their insight. When we spend\ntime with our sponsor or other NA members we trust, we can make the first move\nand ask them to tell us what they see about particular areas of our lives to which we\nare blind. We want a broader vision of our life than just our own; we can have that\nvision by seeing ourselves through the eyes of others.\n\nJust for today: I seek to see myself as I truly am. I will listen to what others say\nabout me, and see myself through their eyes.\n\n\n378\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-30": "Action and prayer\n\n\"... growth is not the result of wishing but of action and prayer\"\nBasic Text, pp. 35-36\n\nSometimes it seems as if our recovery is growing much too slowly. We struggle with\nthe steps; we wrestle with the same problems; we labor under the same\nuncomfortable feelings day after day. We wish that recovery would move a little\nfaster so we could find some comfort!\n\nWishing doesn't work in recovery; this isn't a program of magic. If wishes cured\naddiction, we all would have been well long ago! What does give us relief in recovery\nis action and prayer.\n\nNarcotics Anonymous has worked for so many addicts because it is a carefully\ndesigned program of action and prayer. The actions we undertake in each of the\nsteps bring more and more recovery to each area of our lives. And prayer keeps us\nconnected to our Higher Power. Together, action and prayer keep us well-grounded\nin recovery.\n\nJust for today: My recovery is too precious to just wish about it. Today is a good day\nfor action and prayer.\n\n\n379\nJust For Today\nMeditations for recovering addicts",
  "12-31": "Being of service\n\n\"Working with others is only the beginning of service work.\"\nBasic Text, p 56\n\nWe're in recovery now. Through living the program, we've attained some stability in\nour lives. Our faith in a Higher Power has grown. Our individual spiritual awakening\nis progressing comfortably. So now what? Do we simply sit still and enjoy? Of course\nnot. We find a way to be of service.\n\nWe tend to think of service only in terms of committee service or holding a position\nat some level, but service goes far beyond this understanding. In fact, we can find\nopportunities to be of service in nearly every area of our lives. Our jobs are a form of\nservice to our communities, no matter what our occupation. The work we do in our\nhomes serves our families. Perhaps we do volunteer work in our communities.\n\nWhat a difference our service efforts make! If we doubt this, we can just imagine\nwhat the world would be like if no one bothered to be of service to others. Our work\nserves humanity. The message we carry goes beyond the rooms of recovery,\naffecting everything we do.\n\nJust for today: I will look for opportunities to be of service in everything I do."
